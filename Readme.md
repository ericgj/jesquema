# jesquema

  [JSON Schema][1] validator for javascript

## Features
  
  - modular; for example, v4 of the spec is entirely implemented by plugins
  - built-in formats for date-time, email, hostname, ipv4, ipv6, uri
    as well as ISO8610 datetime, date, time, regex strings
  - extensive error/assertion reporting
  - extendable context (results) object
  - schema flattening (i.e. list top-level schemas that the instance is valid 
    against, for extracting descriptive data about the instance).
